# Latte UI
An easy-to-use UI library created by [Bas Milius](https://bas.dev).

### ⚠️ Early development
This version of Latte UI is still in development, and you should expect a lot of breaking
changes. Please create issues for missing features or regressions so that we can fix them
as soon as possible.

### 🚀 Get started
We haven't released a npm package yet, so working with our library is a bit different. Follow
the steps below to get a project up and running. The Yarn package manager is required.
 - Clone the project.
 - Create a Vue UI application inside the packages-folder.
 - Import LatteUI and use it as a plugin with Vue.
